# Crowdfunding_ETL
# An  ETL mini project,  working with a partner to practise building an ETL pipeline
# using Python, Pandas, and either  Python dictionary methods or
# regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
# After  transforming the data,   four CSV files were created and  these CSV file data is used to create an ERD 
# and a table schema. Finally, uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
# csv files and ERD plus sql files are saved in resoueces folder.
